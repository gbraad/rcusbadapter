<h1 align="center">Wireless RC Adapter 🎮</h1>

**A blazing fast adapter for connecting RC receivers to the computer with just an Arduino** (or similar), making possible to play wireless as it meant to be. Already supporting ***PWM*** and ***PPM*** modulations with ***16bit resolution***, the two most popular protocols which is being used by RC receivers and transmitters. So there is no need to hook the radio transmitter with cables to the simulator anymore. Just plug it in the ***USB port and play***. Also it is compatible with a wide range of devices, like the ones running ***Windows, Mac, Linux*** or ***Android/iOS***, so literally almost anything what supports an USB joystick. Aimed to be fast and responsible, though simple to use.

## Donation 🍺
**The code above is completely free**, *but the devices involved in the development are not.* You can make a donation here to support the development and speed it up:

> For example i would be more than glad to expand the number of supported protocols, but hard to develop something if don't have one. So that's what i'm going to use it for. Don't forget to leave your name in comment of donation, then i paste it in the Credits section.
